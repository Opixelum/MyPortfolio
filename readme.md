# MyPortflio website

http://localhost/MyPortfolio/

I want to make a portflio to showcase my projects, experience and talk about
me. I want to build a modern, well designed portofolio, with a code-oriented
interface.

It will act like my resume (I will put a link to this website on my real
resume). I also want to put my portfolio's link on all my medias.

The whole website will contain only one page, in order to have an interactive
experience.

## What to include

- About me
- Professional experience
- Diplomas
- Skills
- Projects
- Contact

## Technologies to use

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- PHP
- Check for best framework

## Future goal

- Host the website on the blockchain;
- Having a french and an english versions.
